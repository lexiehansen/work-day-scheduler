# Work Day Scheduler
Create daily planner to manage tasks throughout the work day.

Objectives:
- When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours. I chose 9-5.
- When I view the time blocks for that day, then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future
- When I clock into a time block, then I can enter an event
- When I click the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
- When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist
